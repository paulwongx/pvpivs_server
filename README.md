TODO:
- [DONE] Filter to remove shadow pokemon when getting popular pokemon
- [DONE] Check that the number of pokmeon in the gameMaster didn't change

Notes:
- Need to use `node-fetch` because it is one of the only options that can use `commonjs`
  - Need to install `node-fetch@2.0` though and not the latest, otherwise it won't work
